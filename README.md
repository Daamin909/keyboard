The case was made in Fusion360.

I chose to add branding on the bottom case and plate.
PS:- The top case also has branding on the bottom side, not on top because I thought it might ruin the aesthetics.

## Notes :-

I want all the three 3D-printed parts to be printed in black color.
^ that includes: TOP.step, BOTTOM.step, MIDDLE.step.
I want the 1x Rotary encoder knob as well.

Some of the above items, were ordered in packs due to unavailability of singular items.
2x extra switches, extra keycaps, extra nuts, bolts, heatsets, diodes, and one extra RE (can be used for my hackpad, if not sent from hackclub.)
