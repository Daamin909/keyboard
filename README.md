The case was made in Fusion360.

I chose to add branding on the bottom case only for aesthetics.
In order for the parts to be 3d printed, they're divided into 2 each.

## Total Pricing

The keyboard comes out to be INR 9,519.72 ($110.73) when adding ordered parts and PCB. Does not include 3D - Printed case, Pico and Knob.
The PCB seems very costly when adding the shipping to India ($20), @qcoral please try to find alts for indians, or this is very very expensive.
PS:- (Seed Studio is $142 so thats not possible ðŸ’€)

## Notes :-

I want all the six 3D-printed parts to be printed in black color.
^ that includes: TOP1.step, TOP2.step, BOTTOM1.step, BOTTOM2.step, MIDDLE1.step and MIDDLE2.step
I want the 1x Rotary encoder knob as well.

Some of the above items, were ordered in packs due to unavailability of singular items.
2x extra switches, extra keycaps, extra nuts, bolts, heatsets, diodes, and one extra RE (can be used for my hackpad, if not sent from hackclub.)
